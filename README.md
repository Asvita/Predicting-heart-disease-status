## Overview
In this project, the Cleveland CAD dataset from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) was used. The aim of this project was to build a model using machine learning methods to predict the presence of heart disease based on the results of several medical tests and patients’ gender and age, and provide some insights on day-to- day medical practice.

## Motivation
Heart diseases are the leading cause of death in the US[1]. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), the number of deaths due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is 840,678 in the US in 2016, and that is one third the number of all deaths[2]. In many cases, cardiovascular diseases do not show any visible symptoms until it is too late[3]. Early accurate diagnosis of CVD can help patients take timely appropriate treatments and improve survival.
