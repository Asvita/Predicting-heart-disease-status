In this project, the Cleveland CAD dataset from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) was used. The aim of this project was to build a model using machine learning methods to predict the presence of heart disease based on the results of several medical tests and patients’ gender and age, and provide some insights on day-to- day medical practice.
